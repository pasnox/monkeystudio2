Branch "dev" was created for avoid problems with merging modifications, maked by Monkey developers and storing CURRENT code ( possible not working )
Branch policy: 
	Code, stored in the "dev" can be not working, but ALL code should be COMPILIBLE, and MUST NOT CRASH ENTIRE APPLICATION and MUST NOT distrub work of other modules.
	
	When you modifing already existing in the repository code, ALL MODIFICATIONS MUST BE COMMITED. Even module, plugin, for wich modifications need,  do not works now and not exist in the repository.  It's need for avoid problems with future merging modifications.
	
	Even if you not modified core or other existing code, store please sources you created in the repository.  It's may be enteresting for other developers to read your code and ideas, your hard drive can die, ...
	
	If you need to make something, that can distrub work of other monkey parts, or some thing experemental, what possible will not applyed in the trunc, make it on you own branch.
	
	When you maked something working, told project leader. He must review modified(added) code and move changes to the  trunc.
