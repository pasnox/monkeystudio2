v2.2 27th February 2008
  - Based on Scintilla v1.75.
  - A lexer's default colour, paper and font are now written to and read from
    the settings.
  - Windows64 is now supported.
  - The signature of the QsciScintillaBase::SCN_MACRORECORD() signal has
    changed slightly.
  - Changed the licensing to match the current Qt licenses, including GPL v3.

v2.1 1st June 2007
  - A slightly revised API, incompatible with QScintilla v2.0.
  - Lexers now remember their style settings.  A lexer no longer has to be the
    current lexer when changing a style's color, end-of-line fill, font or
    paper.
  - The color(), eolFill(), font() and paper() methods of QsciLexer now return
    the current values for a style rather than the default values.
  - The setDefaultColor(), setDefaultFont() and setDefaultPaper() methods of
    QsciLexer are no longer slots and no longer virtual.
  - The defaultColor(), defaultFont() and defaultPaper() methods of QsciLexer
    are no longer virtual.
  - The color(), eolFill(), font() and paper() methods of all QsciLexer derived
    classes (except for QsciLexer itself) have been renamed defaultColor(),
    defaultEolFill(), defaultFont() and defaultPaper() respectively.

v2.0 26th May 2007
  - A revised API, incompatible with QScintilla v1.
  - Hugely improved autocompletion and call tips support.
  - Supports both Qt v3 and Qt v4.
  - Includes Python bindings.
